# Tic Tac Toe

A rendition of tic tac toe game played inside the terminal for two human players. 

The choice of 'X' and 'O' are randomized. 

Also included with this version of the game is the prototype before refacturing with all the comments, variables and bugs written with Croatian localization. The v1.0 of the game is remade with only the comments being written in Croatian and all the variables are in English.

The structure of the code and naming conventions are such that no docstrings are needed to explain what each function does. However, the translated English names for the functions are litteral translations from Croatian talking/thinking expressions not localized for English expressions spoken by natives (ex. Cro: Inventing hot water = Eng: Reinventing the wheel)
